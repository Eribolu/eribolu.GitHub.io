<dt> Dear Oluwaseun, </dt>
<dd>While I was thinking of what to write, I realized that I had so much to say about you.

It became really hard to put best memories together because I have many of them but I think I just want to thank you for a few things.

<p> <h2> Thank you for being a supporter </h2> </p>

My first contact with you was you showing me support, I can remember how that message from a "stranger" made me smile for days. Since then you have been a big supporter of my works and vision.

I really cannot thank you enough. Your words of encouragement always come at the right time.

<p> <h2> Thank you for the sacrifices </h2> </p>

You are a beautiful soul when it comes to sacrifices. Whenever I remember how you stayed up to cheer me up on days I was tired of everything and days I wasn't feeling  great. 

<p> <h2> Thank you for the dry jokes 😂😂 </h2> </p>

Thank you for always making me laugh 😂😂😂😂. You really have a nice sense of humour and they can be annonying sometimes 🌚.

<p> <h2> Thank you for the fellowship </h2> </p>

This has to be the one of the sweetest memory of us that I hold dear to my heart. Thank you for the regular worship sessions and the prayers. God bless you and thank you for always sleeping during some lmaooo😂😂😂🙄.

<p> <h2> Thank you for always showing GRIT </h2> </p>

I know the last few months has been full of those letters of rejections but it's really amazing to see you thrive with courage. This is me saying that I appreciate your courage during times like this and I pray that God will continue to strengthen you.

<p> <h2> My wishes and prayer for you this new year </h2> </p>

<p> I pray that you have more fun this year. You work really had and K-dramas aren't the only fun thing in life.😑</p>

<p> I pray you land your dream internships and opportunities.</p>

<p> I wish you genuine happiness without sorrow and sadness.</p>

<p> More profit and income this new year.💸💵</p>

<p> I pray that your love and interest for God grows stronger than ever before.</p>

<p> I pray that you find favour in all the areas of your life and wherever you find yourself.</p>

<p> God will continue to answer all your prayers.</p>

<p> Continue to live the will of God for your life.</p>

<p> Thank you for all that you do Oluwaseun, I don't know if I say this often but I am so proud of you.</p>

I guess this is long already and I still have a lot to say but this code thing I am writing is already proving stubborn. Sighs.

<p>Till I come your way again🖤, I want to remind you that I am <a href= https://youtu.be/uE_PO0ZyEm4> here for you </a> </p>

<h3> Love from Erioluwa😊 (Your mentee) </h3> </dd>
